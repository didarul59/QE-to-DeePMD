Modern atomistic simulations often bridge first-principles accuracy with machine learning speed. This tutorial provides a complete workflow starting from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations using Quantum ESPRESSO, through training a deep neural network interatomic potential using DeePMD-kit, and finally to running large-scale Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with LAMMPS using the trained model.

We specifically focus on the example of CHâ‚„, demonstrating:

- How to run DFT-based molecular dynamics (MD) and variable-cell MD (vc-MD) to sample high-quality atomic configurations.
- How to extract structural, energetic, force, and stress data from Quantum ESPRESSO outputs.
- How to convert that data into a format suitable for DeePMD-kit and train a robust potential.
- How to validate and apply the trained model in LAMMPS for large-scale simulations.

All steps are technical and practical, with minimal theory. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to convert Quantum ESPRESSO output files for use in DeePMD-kit training. All steps are technical; no theoretical background provided.
